    "- The test accuracy varies slightly as the sample size increases. It starts at 1.0 for a test size of 0.1 but decreases slightly to 0.95 for a test size of 0.2. However, it then stabilizes around 0.97 to 0.98 for larger sample sizes (test sizes of 0.3 to 0.5). This suggests that the model's performance is affected by the volume of the sample to some extent, but it stabilizes as the sample size increases.\n",

    "Overall, while the `malicious_benign_grid.py` model seems robust to changes in sample size, the `random_classification_grid.py` model shows slight variations in performance with changes in sample size, though it remains relatively stable for larger sample sizes. The influence of sample volume on model quality seems more pronounced in the latter case."
